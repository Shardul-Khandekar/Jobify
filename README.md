## Working Demo

https://github.com/Swaranjali167/Jobify/assets/72608245/17107cf3-d1af-4586-8ef1-bcd36a8ab25d

## What's new? (Delta, New Features)
- Code Refactoring: Modularization the codebase. We reconfigured the database and implemented cascading features to simplify operations. Also, we split the functionalities into multiple files to create modularity and reduce single source of failure.

- UI and UX: We completely changed the UI and UX of the Job aggregator to make it easier for user as well as owner to manage, edit and work smoothly. The new UI uses minimalism and provides only required data in a concise format.

- Validations: We validated input for password, email, name, job type, and location for better user experience and for having clean data.
  
- Analytics: Integrated functionality for getting job counts per dashboard in the mail sent to the user. Included company name and dates when jobs were posted.
  
- Password recovery: Added functionality for sending mail to users for password recovery so that the user can reset the password.

- Code Coverage: Test Cases The project had very few test cases when we took over. From there, we have added test cases for both existing and new features. Our code coverage currently stands at 96%, with 40+ test cases.

## Work for the upcoming iteration

- Include additional job posting platforms.
- Enhance filtering options by incorporating criteria such as degree prerequisites, visa sponsorship availability, years of experience required, and salary ranges.
- Integrate Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication with popular services like Gmail, Github, and Indeed.
- Develop a homepage dashboard to display the count of job listings per job board and the best match percentage for each posting.
- Give users the option to select their preferred notification method, whether it's via email or SMS.
- Implement job data caching for a specified duration to prevent redundant entries.

ðŸ”±: Installation Guide
---
- After Cloning the Github repository (git clone https://github.com/Swaranjali167/Jobify) to a desired location on your computer. Please follow the steps given below to set up the project to a working condition.
- Host your MySQL DB using an application by following these steps.
  * **Create a MySQL instance in your local** 
    + [Installation instruction for local](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-getting-started/en/#mysql-getting-started-installing)
  or
  * **Create a MySQL instance in AWS**
    + [Installation instruction AWS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng_zi11N4_c)
- Execute Jobify/code/Database/schema/srijas.sql file in the created db
- Update your DB credentials in the db.properties.template file.
- Provide executable permissions for setup.sh and execute the file.
- Update the admin's email ID and password in the main.py file for sending job notification mail.

This will install all the required packages from requirements.txt and create a parameters.json file which is required for accessing the DB.
- You can either choose to host the project on any online hosting platform or use an application to test the application locally. We used two applications to host the webpage in local -> XAMPP and MAMP Pro
  * [MAMP Pro](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/)
    + [Installation instructions](https://documentation.mamp.info/en/MAMP-PRO-Mac/)
  * [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
    + If you wish to use XAMPP, download the application and click on the Config button (see picture below)
    
      <img width="607" alt="xampp-conf" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28624935/143979475-f2d4b1d6-297c-43ff-8cb5-d243e59ebc57.png">
    + Click the Apache(httpd.conf) file and add the your project's directory under "DocumentRoot:"
      ```
        DocumentRoot ".../Jobify/code/Web_app"
        <Directory ".../Jobify/code/Web_app">
      ```
- After setting up the project, create executable permissions for the following files - run_notifier.sh and start_server.sh
  * To run the job notifier once -> execute run_notifier.sh
  * To run the scheduler -> execute start_server.sh

- You should be good to start working on the application now.

## Testing

We use pytest to perform testing on all unit tests together. The command needs to be run from the home directory of the project. The command is:
```
python -m pytest test/
```

## Code Coverage

Code coverage is part of the build. Every time new code is pushed to the repository, the build is run, and along with it, code coverage is computed. This can be viewed by selecting the build, and then choosing the codecov pop-up on hover.

Locally, we use the coverage package in python for code coverage. The commands to check code coverage in python are as follows:

```
coverage run -m pytest test/
coverage report
```
